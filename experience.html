	<h4>Chief Software Architect</h4>
        <p><time datetime="2022-01-01 00:00">2022</time> - <time datetime="2025-01-01 00:00">2025</time></p>
	<p>
           For the past three years I have been working for the Zurich-based startup Pelt8. 
           I have lead a team of myself and two other developers in building an application to ease 
           the collection, management and reporting of ESG data for the swiss market. The application 
           allows customers to collect ESG data in single places, and develop custom formulae to 
           aggregate and combine the data to get COâ‚‚ emissions data for reporting purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
	   The application is built on top of Azure, using Azure Static Web Apps and .NET for the backend,
           Azure SQL for the database, and a React SWA using Typescript, React Router and Material UI for the frontend. 
           The backend is a monolithic REST API that utilises a Functional core / Imperative shell architecture. 
           The majority of the backend code is written in C#, with complex core business logic such as formula
           calculations written in F#. Database integration and development is managed via EF Core, which 
           we have used in a code first manner to facilitate rapid development. The front end is a React SPA that
           uses a simple hooks based arcitecture, leveraging the standard react hooks for state management. The SPA is 
           delivered via the Azure Front Door CDN.
        </p>
	<p>
	   The application is secured via Entra. Access to the application requires signing in via Entra, which 
           requires two-factor authentication. The application services themselves are deployed behind a virtual
           network. Public access is turned off, and the resources communicate via private endpoints. Any access to
           the services requires entra authentication and role based authorisation. All data storage is backed up.
	</p>
        <p>
 	   The application is developed in an Agile manner, with weekly releases from a dev environment 
           to a production environment. CI is done using github actions and bicep for IaC. Thanks to this we 
           can easily assure that our enviroment remains in a prescribed state, and deploy isolated 
           environments for customers with particular security requirements or for prototyping new features.
        </p>
	<p>My work also involves mentoring the junior development of the team, and being a line manager.</>

        <h4>Senior Backend Engineer</h4>
        <p><time datetime="2021-01-01 00:00">2021</time> - <time datetime="2022-01-01 00:00">2022</time></p>

            I worked for the London based free credit score and price comparison app TotallyMoney. During this time I
            worked using F# as my primary language developing microservices in AWS. Totallymoney services millions of
            customers, so my work involved a lot of event based architecture, responding to and pushing to SNS and SQS.
            Data storage was primarily DynamoDB and S3. High traffic meant that services needed to be resiliant to traffic 
            spikes and service outages.
        </p>
	<p>
	    I worked on the onboarding email journey, maintaining a complex state machine that delivered emails to customers 
            on a highly dynamic schedule that could update depening on given customer actions. As well as this I also worked 
            on the integration with open banking to further improve the accuracy of customer credit scores.
