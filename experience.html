      <h3>Chief Software Architect</h3>
      <p><time datetime="2023-01-01">2023</time> - <time datetime="2025-01-01">2025</time></p>
      <p>
        I worked for the Zurich-based sustainability startup Pelt8, leading a team of myself and two other 
        developers in building a web application to ease the collection, management and reporting of ESG 
        data for the Swiss market. The application allows customers to collect ESG data in a single place,
        and develop custom formulae to aggregate and combine the data to get CO₂ emissions data for reporting 
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is built on top of Azure, using Azure Static Web Apps and .NET for the backend,
        Azure SQL for the database, and a React SWA using Typescript, React Router and Material UI for the frontend.
        The backend is a monolithic REST API that utilises a Functional core / Imperative shell architecture.
        The majority of the backend code is written in C#, with complex core business logic such as formula
        calculations written in F#. Database integration and development is managed via EF Core, which
        we have used in a code-first manner to facilitate rapid development. The front end is a React SPA that
        uses a simple hooks-based architecture, leveraging the standard React hooks for state management. The SPA is
        delivered via the Azure Front Door CDN.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work spanned the entire software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering and architecture
        design to implementation and deployment. I was responsible for the major architectural decisions, such 
        as the choice of technology stack, the design of the database schema, and the overall architecture of 
        the application. I also worked closely with the product owner to ensure that the application met the
        needs of the customers, and that the development process was efficient and effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was responsible for guiding the team in the development of the application, ensuring that
        the codebase remained maintainable and scalable as new features were added. I established code review 
        processes, set up automated testing and deployment pipelines via GitHub Actions and Bicep, and ensured
        adherence to best practices such as code documentation and consistent style.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is designed to be secure, scalable, and performant, meeting the security and 
        compliance requirements of SOC2, with extra isolated deployment environments for customers with 
        particular security needs.

      <h3>Senior Backend Engineer</h3>
      <p><time datetime="2021-01-01">2021</time> - <time datetime="2022-01-01">2022</time></p>
      <p>
        I worked for the London-based free credit score and price comparison app TotallyMoney. During this time I
        worked using F# as my primary language developing microservices in AWS. TotallyMoney services millions of 
        customers, so my work involved a lot of event-based architecture, responding to and pushing to SNS and SQS.
        Data storage was primarily DynamoDB and S3. High traffic meant that services needed to be resilient to traffic
        spikes and service outages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked on the customer onboarding email journey, maintaining a complex state machine that delivered 
        emails to customers on a schedule. I was responsible for implementing new functionality to the state machine to 
        support multiple email journey pathways which could be switched between depending on the customer's actions.
        This allowed for a high degree of personalisation of the email journey for each customer, increasing 
        customer engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
         I also worked on the integration of open banking into the application, and the introduction of one-time
         passcode authentication. During this time I was influential in the approaches we used to implement 
         microservices in a resilient manner.

      <h3>Senior Software Engineer</h3>
      <p><time datetime="2018-01-01">2018</time> - <time datetime="2021-01-01">2021</time></p>
      <p>
         I worked for the Frankfurt-based capital markets consultancy Luchst-Probst Associates as a Senior 
         Software Engineer while living in Barcelona. I worked as a Full-Stack Developer on HedgePilot, 
         a web application for managing foreign exchange exposure hedging using artificial intelligence.
         The application was built using Angular with Typescript for the front end, ASP.NET Core for the
         backend API, and SQL Server with EF Core for the database. The application was deployed on Azure, 
         and we ran our agile process on Azure DevOps.
      </p>
      <p>
         In particular, I worked on the validation and warning framework for both the front end forms, the 
         maths libraries used for the many calculations done in the software, the cockpit, and the autosave 
         functionality including debouncing, throttling and retry on errors. I made extensive use of RxJS, 
         and Reactive Forms. I also did some work in Python improving the performance of the AI server, and
         was able to improve the efficiency of the database access by significantly reducing the number of
         database calls made by the application.
      </p>
      <p>
         I mentored and taught junior developers, providing feedback and advocating software engineering 
         with close adherence to good principles such as SOLID, KISS and YAGNI. In aid of this, I held 
         several workshops to raise software engineering knowledge. I gave presentations on good 
         practices in Angular (for example, making proper use of directives and pipes), RxJS, unit testing, 
         and I gave an introductory presentation to all software engineers in the company on functional 
         programming.

      <p>
        I worked in the spectroscopy products division, working on the WiRE software suite, to control 
        and gather data from Renishaw's Raman spectrometer products, and provide the user with tools to perform 
        complex data analysis. As the bulk of the interface was written in MFC and WTL, I had a great deal of
        experience working in C++ using COM. I was involved in five major projects: ongoing development of the 
        main WiRE software; developing the prototype for a new interface for the software suite using WPF; 
        work on a specialized software environment for a medical device called the “Assay Reader” for a 
        subsidiary company using WinForms; work on the user experience for the RA802 pharmaceutical analyser, 
        of which I was project lead; and the implementation of some of the mathematical analysis calculations in 
        .NET, which involved some optimisation and multi-threaded programming.
