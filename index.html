      <p>
        A London-based software engineer with 12 years of experience working on projects ranging from 
        desktop development and full-stack web development to event-driven, microservice-based cloud
        development, and, most recently, leading the development team at an award-winning startup.
      </p>
      <p>Experienced in C#, F#, Typescript, React, Angular, SQL Server, C++, Azure and AWS.</p>
      <p>
        I have a passion for building high-quality, maintainable software and enjoy working with teams to
        deliver robust solutions. I am particularly interested in functional programming and event-driven
        architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I occasionally write articles on software engineering topics, and explore
        unfamiliar technologies. Currently I am working on a side project to try and build a prototype 
        3D game fully functionally in F#. Follow my progress 
        <a href="https://github.com/fswadling/Nu/tree/gameQuest/Projects/GameQuest3DImNui">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from programming, I enjoy games, language learning (reasonably fluent in German, 
        beginner in Spanish), and racket sports.
