        While at Imperial I studied object-oriented programming in C++, using Linux and Eclipse,
        logic programming in Prolog, and took courses in machine learning, mobile robotics, 
        algorithms, and 3D graphics.

        I worked on a group project in collaboration with the airport administration company Amadeus, 
        developing a cross-platform mobile application to track agents at an airport using GPS. I used 
        the PhoneGap platform with HTML5, using the Sencha Touch framework.

        My final project was developing a 3D augmented reality system for use in medical applications.
        The system worked by using two monitors held perpendicular to the user to display a video feed 
        for each eye, and two half-silvered mirrors held diagonally to the monitors for the user to 
        view through. The 3D effect was created from the two reflections and overlaid onto the real 
        scene behind the mirrors. The project involved using OpenGL to develop and calibrate a system 
        for placing a 3D object anywhere in the space in front of the mirrors. OpenCV was used to track 
        markers in front of the mirrors for object overlay. The project also involved the development 
        of an eye-tracking system using OpenCV to accurately determine the correct perspective to be 
        displayed on each monitor.
